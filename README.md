Hello! 
The nature of these workflows is to to make a user friendly series of workflows that are:
-Easy to follow
-Clean and tight (mimicing a more mainstream interface within the comfyui framework)
-Easy to modify via either colapsing the various workflows or exploding the view once unpinning.

These workflows a made to make things efficiant, and easy to follow. Its also meant to be noob friendly! Each workflow as they get updated will include a model list that I used for said workflows.
